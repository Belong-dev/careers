# Careers at Belong

## Welcome to Belong: Revolutionizing the Fan Economy

At Belong, we're not just building an appâ€”we're creating the financial layer of fandom. Imagine a world where your passion for music is rewarded with exclusive perks, seamless financial tools, and direct connections to your favorite artists. That's Belong: a mobile-first platform that merges rewards-driven fan engagement with challenger banking, serving as the ultimate integration and verification layer for the fan economy. Our motto? "Your Love For Music. Rewarded."

We're tackling a fragmented fan economy where artists struggle to identify true supporters, and fans' loyalty goes unrecognized amid bots and scalpers. Artists gain tools to own their fan data, offer direct perks, and keep more revenue without middlemen.

Belong is built on three pillars: Fan Engagement & Rewards , Banking & Financial Services , and an Artist & Partner Platform for direct interactions. Our tech stack is cutting-edge: React Native for frontend, Typescript/Fastify/TypeORM for backend on AWS, with integrations like Synctera for banking and Spotify/Google APIs for data.

We're a passionate, music-loving team redefining fandom and fintech. If you're excited about empowering artists as CEOs of their brands and turning fans into a loyalty flywheel, Belong is where you belong. Join us in bridging the old world of middlemen to a direct-to-fan future.
